# Sensor-reading-With-Pi

Sensor's information reading with a Respberry Pi.

In this project we had to read Sonar's, Light sensor's, ADXL345's and ITG3200's information, and send it to a bus in a JSON format, in the goal to do a drone.  

So there, you'll just find the client side, because the bus has been implemented by another group.
